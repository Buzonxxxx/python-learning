Ted was scrolling on the internet and he came across a video of someone juggling. He thought it looked really cool, so he decided to give it a try. He bought some juggling balls and started practicing in his living room. At first, he was really bad at it and kept dropping the balls. But he kept practicing, and after a few weeks, he was able to juggle three balls at once! Ted was so proud of himself, and he started to feel happier and more confident. The act of juggling gave him something to focus on and look forward to each day.
